## Sample Usage

Add the following lane to your `Fastfile` to use the TeamsX action:

```ruby
lane :notify_teams do
  teamsx(
    # Required parameters
    title: "Release Notification",           # Used as fallback for main_title
    message: "A new version has been released!", # Used as fallback for body
    teams_url: "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/your-webhook-url",

    # Optional parameters for Adaptive Card
    main_title: "ðŸš€ New Release!",           # Large header (optional)
    subtitle: "Production Deployment",       # Subtitle (optional)
    body: "Version 1.2.3 is now live.",     # Main body text (optional)
    mentions: [                              # Optional mentions (array of hashes)
      { "id" => "user-id-1", "name" => "Alice", "at_text" => "Alice" },
      { "id" => "user-id-2", "name" => "Bob", "at_text" => "Bob" }
    ],
    facts: [                                 # Optional facts (array of hashes)
      { "title" => "Environment", "value" => "Production" },
      { "title" => "Version", "value" => "1.2.3" }
    ]
  )
end
```

- Only `title`, `message`, and `teams_url` are required.
- All other parameters are optional and will be included in the Teams message if provided.
- If `main_title` or `body` are not provided, the action will use `title` and `message` as fallbacks.
- You can omit any section (subtitle, mentions, facts) and it will not appear in the card.
